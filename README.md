# fileTerminal
Simple terminal interface for a file manager. The app uses golang and the tcell package to add interactivity with the terminal.
In its current state the users can navigate through directory trees and files. The file rows display information about the file such as 
the size, type, and last update. Future updates will include direct file searches.
